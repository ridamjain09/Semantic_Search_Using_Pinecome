64,Agile and Scrum Project Management,agile-and-scrum-project-management,"This course presents and compares some of the most popular project management frameworks. According to the traditional approach, all projects follow the conventional lifecycle of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and control, and closure. The first part of the course focuses on one example of such type of approach — the so-called Waterfall framework. According to it, activities have a defined start, end, and order and changes to the plan during the execution stage should be avoided. There are, however, certain types of initiatives containing uncertainties that are difficult to structure in a clear manner. Such projects have fewer hard dependencies between deliverables and the best way to order activities is not always obvious beforehand.  The next part of the course covers the Agile framework which is suitable for such situations. It is much more flexible than the traditional approach, allowing for changes and uncertainties during the execution phase. Based on Agile principles, SCRUM is a framework for managing complex projects, such as software development. Next, the course covers in detail this framework.

We examine in detail the individual and portfolio approaches to investing, the portfolio management process, the different types of investors and their needs, the asset management industry, and the existing pooled investment vehicles.

By the end of the Portfolio Management course, you will be able to calculate and interpret the two most common measures of portfolio returns: money-weighted and time-weighted rate of return. We also show you the instruments that characterize the investment opportunities available today and how to find the mean, variance, and correlation of asset returns using historical data.

The next step is learning how to apply this knowledge to optimize the portfolio selection process. You will learn why you shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket and how imperfect correlation between assets leads to diversified portfolios. We continue with the implications of risk aversion and how to shape an investor's profile by combining the optimal risky portfolio and the risk-free asset. The topic ends with a practical example of building a five-asset portfolio in Excel using matrix algebra and the Markowitz optimization process to find the optimal risky portfolio.

Next, we explain why investors should not be compensated for bearing nonsystematic risk. We discuss the difference between the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) and the Capital Market Line (CML) and introduce the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAMP). Armed with the right return-generating model, you will learn how to calculate the expected return of an asset.

Then, we change gear and study investment policy statements from a practical perspective. We begin with the prominence of written statements and continue with the importance of distinguishing between the willingness and the ability to take risks when analyzing an investor’s financial risk tolerance. We also touch on ESG investing and how it can be integrated into portfolio planning and construction.

The last part of the Portfolio Management course is dedicated to risk management. We explain why a firm’s risk management division doesn’t work toward total risk elimination. On the contrary—every business needs to take risks to perform its core operations. So, the risk management team’s role is to alert to and quantify the types of risks a company is currently exposed to.

We lay the foundations by discussing the consequences of combining a risk-free asset with the market portfolio and some key concepts to help you see the big picture. Then, we explain the differences between Capital Allocation Line and Capital Market Line.
We decompose total risk into systematic and nonsystematic risk and discuss their characteristics. After building the necessary theoretical background, we calculate the expected return of an asset. Finally, we examine the security market line and its applications and cover some of the most popular measures for evaluating the performance of a portfolio."

100,Technical Analysis,technical-analysis,"Do you want to become a successful investor?

Then, you must learn the intricacies of technical analysis to develop a personal trading style. This is a popular form of security analysis that uses price and volume data to inform decision-making. It involves many complex concepts and calculations that we teach in this Technical Analysis course. Here’s a peek at what you’ll learn.

The valuation of a security depends on the activity of rational and irrational market participants. Some investors are led by their emotions or “animal spirits.” A bull represents an investor’s optimism, and a bear—their pessimism about a particular security or the market in general. When investors feel bullish, stock prices go up. Reversely, when investors feel bearish, stock prices go down. 

Since the market is under the influence of such social-behavioral phenomena, it is not always efficient. So, we need technical analysis to study collective investor psychology. Whether you use it as a stand-alone tool or combine it with fundamental analysis, it is an excellent indicator of a security's optimal price-entry and exit points.

Our Technical Analysis course teaches you the major principles, assumptions, and practical applications of this technique. You will learn how to construct and interpret charts and patterns and analyze important indicators. We explain the Elliot Wave Theory and the importance of the Fibonacci numbers to help you understand how technical analysts use cycles. This stock technical analysis course ends with a lesson on Intermarket analysis and its role in asset allocation.

Are you looking to enhance your stock market investments and make informed trading decisions based on data-driven insights? This Technical Analysis course is just what you need. Enroll now and elevate your trading skills.",Learn to identify market trends and make informed trading decisions using a range of charting techniques and market indicators. Gain an in-depth understanding of the principles and applications of technical analysis and enhance your skills with expert-led lessons and practical market scenarios.,theory,financial analysis,Technical and fundamental analysis are often considered opposing approaches. But I’ll show you how to leverage their combined power to make informed investment decisions.,702,Technical Analysis,"The Technical Analysis course starts with the main concept and assumptions behind this technique. Performing technical analysis without charts is like playing basketball without a ball. So, next, we introduce the most common types of charts technical analysts use: line, bar, candlestick, and point and figure charts.
Then, we examine some key price forecasting tools, such as trading volume and relative strength analysis, and specific mechanics applied when forecasting a security’s performance. You’ll learn the meaning of “trends” and some key concepts used by chart technicians, such as support and resistance levels. But of course, there’s more to technical analysis than that.
The art of trade is in spotting patterns that aren’t obvious to all traders. To help you achieve this, our stock analysis course covers the two main types of patterns: reversal and continuation. We explain what technical analysts call “head and shoulders” and show you examples of “double tops” and “double bottoms” price patterns.
We also explore common technical analysis indicators to help you grasp the practicalities. We start with price indicators, such as the moving average and Bollinger Bands, and continue with momentum oscillators, such as the relative strength index and the rate of change, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and stochastic oscillators. Next, the Technical Analysis course covers several non-price-based indicators, such as the put/call and short interest ratios, frequently used by technical analysts to supplement chart analysis.
Toward the end of the stock analysis course, we explore how technical analysts utilize cycles and the key tenants of Elliot Wave and Fibonacci numbers. Lastly, we look at the big picture and show you how technical analysts examine different asset classes and securities in parallel."
